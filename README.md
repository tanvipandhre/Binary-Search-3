## Problem1 
Pow(x,n) (https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
* do it using recursion
* even condition , in odd have +ve condition & -ve condition
* T - O(logn), S - O(logn)


## Problem2 
Find K Closest Elements (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)
* Solving using Two pointers, left at start of array, right at end of array
* we need to return k closest elements to x. x might or might not be in the array. Array is sorted.
* move the pointer which has lowest distance, if equal also move left. T - O(n-k) + O(k) = O(n), S - O(1)
